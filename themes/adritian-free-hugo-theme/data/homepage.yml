  subtitle: "M.S. in Computer Science, University of Florida"
  description: >
    Expected to graduate in the spring of 2026, I am currently enrolled as a full-time student at the University of Florida's Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering. 
    While I am earning my master's degree in computer science, I am primarily focusing my studies on the technical end of video game development.<br><br>
    I began my enrollment as a graduate student immediately following the completion of my bachelor's degree. 
    In the summer of 2024, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science at the University of Florida, majoring in computer science and minoring in digital arts and sciences.

  title: "About Me"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      With a logical mind and creative heart, I'm always looking to explore avenues 
      that satisfy both halves of my psyche. That passion for creation led me towards game 
      development, but it was my desire for challenge that made me enamored by its technical 
      aspects.
      </p>  
      <p class="lead">
      Finding that passion has fueled a deep motivation to impact the field. My entire year
      has been spent predomimantly conducting research, first for UF's computer graphics lab,
       <a href='https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/SurfLab/'>SurfLab</a>, and now studying abroad in Japan
      helping Kyoto University's computer vision research department improve their Unreal Engine simulations.
      </p>  
      <p class="lead">
      Following the completion of my degree, I'm aiming to enter the field of
      game development, either through a technical engineering or design role.
      In the meantime, I'll be keeping my thoughts filed on my blog, <a href='https://leespeak.me'>LEE_SPEAK</a>,
      and continuing work on my research and personal endeavors.
    </p>
