  subtitle: "Computer Science Graduate Student @ UF"
  description: >
    Expected to graduate in the Spring of 2026, I am currently enrolled as a full-time student at the University of Florida's Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering. 
    While I am earning my master's degree in computer science, I am primarily focusing my studies within the discipline of <b>Computer Graphics</b>.<br>
    I began my enrollment as a graduate student immediately following the completion of my bachelor's degree. 
    In the Summer of 2024, I graduated with a bachelor's in science at the University of Florida, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Digital Arts and Sciences.

    <p class="lead">
      With a logical mind and creative heart, I'm always looking to explore avenues 
      that satisfy both halves of my psyche. That wish to create led me towards game 
      development, but it was my desire for challenge that brought me to the field of 
      computer graphics.
      </p>  
      <p class="lead">
      Finding that passion has fueled a deep motivation to impact the field.
      Beginning in the Spring of 2025, I will be conducting supervised 
      research under Professor Jorg Peters at UF's 3D graphics
      laboratory, <a href='https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/SurfLab/'>SurfLab</a>.
      
      </p>  
      <p class="lead">
      Following the completion of my degree, I'm aiming to enter the field of
      real-time graphics, either as a graphics programmer or game engine developer.
      In the meantime, I'll be working on my own 3D engine, <a href='https://github.com/liamckenna/APGP'>APGP</a>,
      alongside the rest of my creative and technical endeavors.
