SteamQuack.com serves as an entertaining way for PC gamers to find new games based on their personal tastes. Users submit their Steam profile, and a
taste profile is generated based on the data available through Steam’s API. The user can then tell the site’s
host, a literal “quack doctor” named Ducktor Gamez, exactly what they do and don’t care about when looking
for a game, which he will consider before generating game suggestions back to the user.
