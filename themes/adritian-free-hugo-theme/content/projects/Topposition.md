Topposition was originally created as a board game for a class assignment, but eventually turned into an
exercise in C++ programming as it became the first game Iâ€™ve developed without an engine, written in pure
C++, utilizing a single rudimentary graphics library (SDL2). The game boasts a fully procedural terrain
generation system, as well as local and online multiplayer. Topposition is still in development but is fully
playable locally.
