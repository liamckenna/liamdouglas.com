In my two 3D modeling courses, I have become thoroughly familiar with the process of 3D modeling and
rendering. I’ve modeled a variety of objects, architectures, and human characters, all of which can be seen in
this portfolio. My experiences in modeling have been particularly responsible for piquing my interest
in the 3D rendering pipeline, as well as graphics processing as a whole
