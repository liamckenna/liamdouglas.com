### Learning the ropes, grasping responsibility.

As a software development intern, I learned the ins and outs of the software development cycle. In addition to
being the designated intern on a development team, I worked with other interns to create a new program to
assist in the process of debugging new releases of their proprietary software.

Despite ultimately deciding against a career as a software developer (at least, not without a specialization),
the experience remained truly valuable. Through working in a white collar environment for the first time,
I sincerely grasped the importance of accountability and proper work ethic.
