      <title>All-Purpose Graphics Playground (APGP)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;APGP serves as my custom environment to test and implement various aspects of real-time 3D graphics rendering. As a repository, it serves as a personal exercise in making a publicly-accessible codebase that can easily run in a system-agnostic manner, along with simply being an archive of my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SteamQuack.com serves as an entertaining way for PC gamers to find new games based on their personal tastes. Users submit their Steam profile, and a&#xA;taste profile is generated based on the data available through Steam’s API. The user can then tell the site’s&#xA;host, a literal “quack doctor” named Ducktor Gamez, exactly what they do and don’t care about when looking&#xA;for a game, which he will consider before generating game suggestions back to the user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sample blog content.

It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect blend for designers and writers who crave a dash of creativity and meaning in their placeholder text. Imagine a text that not only fills the space but also sparks the imagination, a text that weaves tales of innovation, inspiration, and the endless possibilities that creativity brings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Topposition</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/topposition/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/topposition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Topposition was originally created as a board game for a class assignment, but eventually turned into an&#xA;exercise in C++ programming as it became the first game I’ve developed without an engine, written in pure&#xA;C++, utilizing a single rudimentary graphics library (SDL2). The game boasts a fully procedural terrain&#xA;generation system, as well as local and online multiplayer. Topposition is still in development but is fully&#xA;playable locally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3D Modeling</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/3d-modeling/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/3d-modeling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my two 3D modeling courses, I have become thoroughly familiar with the process of 3D modeling and&#xA;rendering. I’ve modeled a variety of objects, architectures, and human characters, all of which can be seen in&#xA;this portfolio. My experiences in modeling have been particularly responsible for piquing my interest&#xA;in the 3D rendering pipeline, as well as graphics processing as a whole&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Software Development Intern</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/experience/job-1/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/experience/job-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-the-ropes-grasping-responsibility&#34;&gt;Learning the ropes, grasping responsibility.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a software development intern, I learned the ins and outs of the software development cycle. In addition to&#xA;being the designated intern on a development team, I worked with other interns to create a new program to&#xA;assist in the process of debugging new releases of their proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite ultimately deciding against a career as a software developer (at least, not without a specialization),&#xA;the experience remained truly valuable. Through working in a white collar environment for the first time,&#xA;I sincerely grasped the importance of accountability and proper work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
