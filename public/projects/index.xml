      <description>&lt;p&gt;APGP serves as my custom environment to test and implement various aspects of real-time 3D graphics rendering. As a repository, it serves as a personal exercise in making a publicly-accessible codebase that can easily run in a system-agnostic manner, along with simply being an archive of my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Topposition</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/topposition/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/topposition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Topposition was originally created as a board game for a class assignment, but eventually turned into an&#xA;exercise in C++ programming as it became the first game I’ve developed without an engine, written in pure&#xA;C++, utilizing a single rudimentary graphics library (SDL2). The game boasts a fully procedural terrain&#xA;generation system, as well as local and online multiplayer. Topposition is still in development but is fully&#xA;playable locally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SteamQuack.com serves as an entertaining way for PC gamers to find new games based on their personal tastes. Users submit their Steam profile, and a&#xA;taste profile is generated based on the data available through Steam’s API. The user can then tell the site’s&#xA;host, a literal “quack doctor” named Ducktor Gamez, exactly what they do and don’t care about when looking&#xA;for a game, which he will consider before generating game suggestions back to the user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3D Modeling</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/3d-modeling/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/3d-modeling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my two 3D modeling courses, I have become thoroughly familiar with the process of 3D modeling and&#xA;rendering. I’ve modeled a variety of objects, architectures, and human characters, all of which can be seen in&#xA;this portfolio. My experiences in modeling have been particularly responsible for piquing my interest&#xA;in the 3D rendering pipeline, as well as graphics processing as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Itch.io Games</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/itch-page/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my tenure at UF, I&amp;rsquo;ve created several smaller-scale games for various projects.&#xA;These include game jams, class projects, hackathons, and personal ventures. The process of working&#xA;with others on these titles has demonstrated and further developed my programming, designing, artistic,&#xA;and leadership skills. All of these creations can be seen and downloaded on my Itch page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CPU Ray Tracer</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/cpu-ray-tracer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/liamdouglas.com/projects/cpu-ray-tracer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This ray tracer was built 100% from scratch and only utilizes OpenGL to apply the rendered bitmap to a camera-covering texture. It performs all calculations on the CPU and was written in&#xA;C++. While the code is not available on GitHub, the rendered demo can be found on my YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
